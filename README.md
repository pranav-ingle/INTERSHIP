Population Data Analysis and GitHub Integration
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that analyzes world population data and demonstrates the process of pushing the notebook to a GitHub repository.

Notebook Contents
The notebook performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Loads population data from a CSV file (API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv).
Data Inspection: Displays the first few rows and column names of the dataset to understand its structure.
Data Visualization: Generates visualizations to explore the population data, specifically:
A histogram showing the distribution of population in 2024.
A bar chart showing the top 10 countries by population in 2024.
GitHub Integration: Includes steps to initialize a Git repository, add and commit changes, and push the notebook to a specified GitHub repository.
How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the required dataset (API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv) to your Colab environment.
Run the code cells sequentially to perform data loading, inspection, and visualization.
To push the notebook to your own GitHub repository, update the GitHub repository URL in the relevant cell and execute the Git commands. You may need to configure your Git identity and use a Personal Access Token for authentication.
Requirements
Google Colab environment
Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
